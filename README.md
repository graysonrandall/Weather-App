# Weather-App

https://graysonrandall.github.io/Weather-App/weather-app.html

This is a small Weather App I made based on some data from the San Francisco Chronicle.

It features:
  - Calling JSONP as a function
  - Display dynamic data with JS
  - Parsing a small amount of JSON
  - CSS3 Pseudo Selectors
  - CSS3 Flex Box
